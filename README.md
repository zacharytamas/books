## What is this?

Initially this project is just a learning tool for my Financial Accounting class. To test and improve my learning I am using a TDD approach for writing code from scratch that enforces my understanding.

The idea is that by implementing all of the calculations and relationships myself I will understand them better. Also for our homeworks we are often given some of the values which I can insert into tests and use this as an auto-grader partially.

I'm also using it as an opportunity to try out `Jest` for tests. :P

For now this is all this is. Though I may eventually refactor this into something useful for others and share it on `npm`.
